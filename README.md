# Mabinogi Fashion (Looking for name recommendations!)
**This is currently a work in progress, and overall design is subject to change over time.**  
**Send me a message if you would like to help out. I can't pay anything though, but I'd appreciate any help.**

This is a web application designed for Mabinogi players to share their fashion ideas to other fashionistas.  
We all know fashion in the real endgame, so what better way to show how good your Milletian looks than a catalog? It could be previous outfits that you put together or even cosplay. Maybe you want to wear something that you wore in the past, but forgot what the pieces were. You'll be able to see all of that here.  
The end goal is to have a relatively centralized website for the North America region that we can all browse for clothing ideas, however if there is some success, then I would like it to branch out to the other regions as well.  
For now, it would be nice to have a minimum viable product that functions well, and then work on improving things afterwards.

### In Development:
```
- Account login and creation (basic functioning prototype, still local though)
```

### Planned features: 
```
- Fashion catalog page (not started)
- Design uploading (not started)
- Personal profile (not started)
- And more! Need ideas.
```

This is a passion project and a way to give back to a game that's dear to me. Also, not affiliated at all with Nexon.
